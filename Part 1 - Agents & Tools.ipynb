    "Welcome! In this series, we will build **ResumeGuide**, a 3-agent system to help B.Tech students craft better resumes using **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** with **Vertex AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 3 Agents:**\n",
    "1. **ProfileBot** - Collects your info (Branch, Skills, Projects)\n",
    "2. **ReviewerBot** - Critiques your resume sections\n",
    "3. **CoachBot** - Gives industry-specific career advice\n",

    "\n",
    "**Single Agent Limitation**: One agent doing everything becomes hard to manage and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Agent Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has ONE job (collect info, review, advise)\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Swap or upgrade agents independently\n",
    "- **Better Prompts**: Smaller, focused instructions work better than giant ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Google ADK + Vertex AI?**\n",
    "- **Official Framework**: Google's ADK is the official agent development kit for Gemini\n",
    "- **Data Privacy**: Student resume data stays in your GCP project\n",
    "- **Auto Tool Calling**: ADK handles function calling automatically\n",
    "- **Production Ready**: Easy deployment to Vertex AI Agent Engine"
